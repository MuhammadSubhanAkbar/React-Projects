# 🔐 Encryption App

A simple React-based encryption and decryption tool.  
It uses a **basic Caesar cipher** technique where each letter is shifted by one place in the alphabet.

## ✨ Features
- Encrypts input text (shift forward by 1).
- Decrypts input text (shift backward by 1).
- Preserves case (uppercase and lowercase).
- Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.
- Minimal UI styled with Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Demo
1. Enter any message in the input field.
2. Click **Encrypt** to shift letters forward.
3. Click **Decrypt** to shift letters backward.
4. The result is displayed below.
